## Abstract
The project abstract is as below:

The primary aim of this project is to investigate whether there is an attentional difference in groups who have their webcam switched on in comparison to those who have it switched off in a videoconferencing setting. It also aims to assess whether there are any other relevant extraneous factors which may contribute to varying levels of attention in videoconferencing settings, and to add to the literature regarding specific components of videoconferencing, such as use of webcams. The primary issue recognised in this experiment is the fact that virtual meetings do not adequately replicate the human dynamics of in-person meetings, which is evident from the significant figures of mental health complications, biases towards in-person workers, meeting fatigue due to over-stimulation and overuse of mental resources, among others. To commence investigating the beginning of a new, natural, and comfortable method of videoconferencing, this experiment focuses specifically on the effects of the webcam. In this experiment, 58 individuals participated in a 10-minute pre-recorded meeting about the future of work and education after the COVID-19 pandemic is over. Change blindness was used to assess attention levels throughout this meeting and, as a result, the backgrounds, outfits, and names of the actors were changed, and participant recall of these were assessed with participants split into conditions based on whether they had their webcam on or off. A significant difference was identified between those who had their webcam on or off in regard to how many backgrounds they correctly identified from participating in the experiment. A further significant difference was found between the webcam conditions and the number of ‘actor one’ backgrounds recalled. A significant correlation was found between the number of backgrounds correctly identified and the time of day the experiment was completed at, as well as a correlation between how interesting participants found the meeting and how difficult they found it to concentrate on the meeting. These results have implications for the future of videoconferencing and prompt the need for further examination if these components are to be improved in the future.
